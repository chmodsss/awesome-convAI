The repository contains a curated list of Conversational AI modules such as Automatic speech recognition (ASR), Dialog systems (Chatbots) and Speech synthesizer (TTS)

## Automatic Speech recognition(ASR) system or Speech-to-text(STT)

Various ASR engines are available as open-source. Based on the underlying architecture, they are classified as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Deep learning models.

HMM ASR:
* [Cmusphinx](https://cmusphinx.github.io/)
* [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org/)

DL ASR:
* [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech)
* [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet)

Commercial ASR (Cloud based solutions):
* [Dragon Speech Recognition](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html)
* [Azure Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/)
* [Google STT](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text)

## Speech synthesizer or Text-to-Speech(TTS)

TTS helps to synthesize audio-speech from text. Eventhough lots of previous TTS systems sound robotic, recent developments in TTS lead to human-like speeches.

## Conversational agent (NLU)

* [Google Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow)
* [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/)
  * Amazon lex is restricted to English language.
* [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson)
* [Wit](https://wit.ai/)
* [Microsoft LUIS](https://www.luis.ai/)
* [Rasa](https://rasa.com/)
  * Rasa does not have ASR support directly, but connecting with an external ASR engine is possible.
